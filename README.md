## About

This project is an attempt to analyze different algorithms and approaches 
to solving Sudoku puzzles.  At first, I will not attempt a brute force approach
though I might add one later to show the difference in performance.  

My initial attempt is based on [Sandiway Fong's Sudoku Heuristics](https://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~sandiway/sudoku/index.html). 
However, the plan is to add others, including: 

* [Bob Hanson's methods](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/explain.htm)
* [Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X)
* [And Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms)


## Todo

* Analyze number of method calls
* Profile time/space cost and attempt to reduce
